          <p>Hello! I'm Tom Righele, a Senior Application Developer at Marsh & McLennan with over four years of experience in app development, integration, and project leadership. My passion for technology runs deep, spanning backend development, website creation, and hardwareâ€”I've built multiple computers for family and friends.</p>
          <p>I'm 38 years old, married to my wonderful wife, and we recently welcomed our newborn son, Tommy. We share our home with our beloved pit bull, Georgie. As a die-hard New York Yankees fan, Mariano Rivera remains my all-time favorite player, and I take pride in being a multi-time fantasy football champion.</p>
          <p>Currently, I'm actively seeking new projects and outside work opportunities. I love connecting with new people, sharing ideas, and exploring innovative collaborations. In my free time, I enjoy working out, spending quality time with family, and occasionally unwinding with a glass of tequila. I embrace life's dynamic aspects.</p>
